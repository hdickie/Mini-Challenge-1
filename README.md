# Mini-Challenge-1
VAST 2017


Below is a simplified of the fictional park that preserves connectivity but not distance. It looks like a kinda cute bug :] The Big circles are completely connected subgraphs. Nodes in these subgraphs that are not labeled appear above. There should not be any records that indicate an edge exists that is not on this graph.

I also did pagerank in R. I realized afterward that this Mini-Challenge is focused on identitfying types and groups of visitors, but it's here if it becomes useful.
